## 🔧 Key Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for state management
- **Photos Framework**: Photo library access and manipulation
- **CryptoKit**: AES-256 encryption and hashing
- **Core Image**: Image analysis and quality detection
- **Accelerate**: High-performance computations

## 🧠 AI Algorithms

### Duplicate Detection

The app uses a **difference hash (dHash)** algorithm for perceptual image comparison:

1. Resize images to 9x8 pixels
2. Convert to grayscale
3. Compare adjacent pixels
4. Generate 64-bit hash
5. Calculate Hamming distance between hashes
6. Images with distance ≤ 5 are considered duplicates

### Quality Analysis

Sharpness detection using **edge detection**:

1. Apply Core Image edge detection filter
2. Calculate pixel intensity variance
3. Normalize to 0-1 quality score
4. Classify as: Excellent (>0.7), Good (>0.5), Fair (>0.3), Poor (>0.15), Blurry (<0.15)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Privacy
- **Zero Data Collection**: No analytics, tracking, or personal data collection
- **On-Device Processing**: All AI and analysis runs locally
- **No Network Requests**: App functions completely offline
- **Transparent Permissions**: Clear explanations for all permission requests

### Security Features
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption for app data
- **Secure Keychain**: Encryption keys never stored in plain text
- **Multi-Pass Shredding**: Overwrite files 3-35 times for secure deletion
- **Sandboxed Environment**: iOS sandbox prevents unauthorized access

## 📱 App Store Compliance

APEX iPhone Cleaner PRO is designed with full App Store guideline compliance:

- ✅ Accurate functionality claims - no exaggeration
- ✅ User-initiated actions - no automated deletions
- ✅ Sandbox restrictions - works within iOS limitations
- ✅ Privacy policy - comprehensive and transparent
- ✅ No misleading features - honest about capabilities
- ✅ Proper permissions - only requests necessary access

### What This App Does NOT Do

To maintain App Store compliance and user trust:
- ❌ Does not access other apps' data or caches (iOS sandbox restriction)
- ❌ Does not perform "deep system cleaning" (not possible on iOS)
- ❌ Does not speed up CPU or RAM (not applicable to iOS)
- ❌ Does not modify system files (sandbox restriction)
- ❌ Does not automatically delete files without user approval

## 🧪 Testing

The app focuses on:
- Photo library access and analysis
- Storage calculations and visualization
